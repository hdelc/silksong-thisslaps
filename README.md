# This Slaps

Slap anything! This adds the slap to Hornet's moveset, regardless of the equipped
crest. By default, the slap is bound to semicolon, deals a flat 15 damage,
and applies no knockback. The keybind, damage, and knockback for the slap are
all configurable via the BepInEx config files or 
[Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager),
so feel free customize the attack to satisfactory power.

## Planned Features

- In-game input binding
- Slapping NPCs
- Controller support

## Installation
